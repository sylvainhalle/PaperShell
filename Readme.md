A Flexible LaTeX Article Environment
====================================

This repository provides a boilerplate environment for writing LaTeX
articles using the popular templates from Springer, IEEE, ACM, AAAI,
Elsevier, etc. It provides:

- The up-to-date style and bibliography files of many different publishers
  (journals and conferences)
- A script that generates the proper preamble (title, list of authors and
  institution) specific to each style
- A very advanced Makefile (by [Chris
  Monson](https://github.com/shiblon/latex-makefile)) taking care of the
  compilation/cleaning process
- Scripts (for both Windows and Linux) to perform spell checking of the
  LaTeX source with [GNU Aspell](http://aspell.net). The words added to the
  dictionary while checking are also versioned with the project.
- A script that can "flatten" your sources into a single compilable .tex file
  (with all includes and bibliography) and export all resources in a
  stand-alone folder (ideal for exporting the camera-ready sources to an
  editor)
- A `.gitignore` file suitable for a single-document LaTeX project
- A script to clean up a BibTeX file

Using this template, switching a paper from any stylesheet to any other
simply amounts to regenerating two files with an included PHP script. You
don't need to change a single line of the main, `paper.tex` document you
are working on. What is more, the project's structure can be imported and
used within [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

Why this template?
------------------

If you have been writing lots of (Computer Science) papers, you may have
been mostly using LaTeX with a couple of different document classes:

- `aaai` for AAAI journals
- `acmart` for ACM conferences and journals
- `easychair` for [EasyChair EPiC Series and Kalpa Publications series](https://easychair.org/publications/for_authors)
- `elsarticle` for Elsevier journals
- `eptcs` for the *Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science*
- `IEEEtran` for IEEE conference proceedings and journals
- `lipics` for the *Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics*
- `llncs` for Springer's *Lecture Notes in Computer Science* series
- `sig-alternate` for ACM conference proceedings
- `stvrauth` and similar for Wiley Journals
- `svjour` for Springer journals
- `usenix2019_v3` for USENIX publications

First off, this repository provides a well-structured template project where
all these classes are included, so you can pick the one you wish when
starting to write. Moreover, it comes with a very powerful Makefile that
does all sorts of nifty things, such as suppressing useless output from
LaTeX and colouring (yes, colouring) its meaningful output (errors in red,
etc.).

There do exist products, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), which
allow you to instantiate a blank LaTeX paper using many of these templates
(PaperShell can interact nicely with Overleaf; see below). However, there might
be various reasons for which you might want to switch an existing document from
one class to the other. For example, you started writing a paper without
deciding where to send it, only to find that the conference you've chosen has a
different publisher than the paper's current style. Or, a paper sent to a
conference (and perhaps rejected) needs to be sent to another venue with a
different publisher. (Note that in the past, it used to be the *publisher's* job
to format your manuscript to their taste. But that's another story.)

Alas, it turns out these stylesheets are not directly interchangeable.
Rather than nicely overriding the behaviour of LaTeX's original commands
from the `article` document class, each class decided to invent its own
commands to, e.g., define the title, authors and institution of a document
--and none of them works the same way. For example, here is how to declare
authors and institutions in `llncs`:

    \author{Emmett Brown\inst{1} \and Marty McFly\inst{1} \and Biff Tannen\inst{2}}
    \institute{%
    Temporal Industries \\
    Hill Valley, CA 90193 \\
    \and
    BiffCo inc. \\
    Hill Valley, CA 90193 \\
    }

...in `IEEEtran`:

    \author{%
    \IEEEauthorblockN{Emmett Brown, Marty McFly}
    \IEEEauthorblockA{%
    Temporal Industries\\
    Hill Valley, CA 90193\\
    }
    \IEEEauthorblockN{Biff Tannen}
    \IEEEauthorblockA{%
    BiffCo inc.\\
    Hill Valley, CA 90193\\
    }
    }

...in `acmart`:

    \author{Emmett Brown}
    \affiliation{
      \institution{Temporal Industries}
      \streetaddress{Hill Valley}
      \state{CA}
      \postcode{90193}
    }
    \author{Biff Tannen}
    \affiliation{
      \institution{BiffCo inc.}
      \streetaddress{Hill Valley}
      \state{CA}
      \postcode{90193}
    }

...and in `elsarticle`:

    \author{Emmett Brown\fnref{label1}}
    \author{Marty McFly\fnref{label1}}
    \author{Biff Tannen\fnref{label2}}
    \fntext{Temporal Industries, Hill Valley, CA 90193}
    \fntext{BiffCo inc., Hill Valley, CA 90193}

Four different sets of commands and syntax for the same data ---and all this
while `article.cls` already provides commands doing exactly that, which
could have easily been overridden! To make things even worse, the class
elsarticle does not even use `\maketitle` to print the title, which must be
enclosed (along with the abstract) within a `frontmatter` environment *after*
the `\begin{document}`. Therefore, switching between classes
requires some amount of braindead, yet frustrating copy-pasting from
existing files you have, which arguably becomes quite mind-numbing when
you've been doing that once in a while for the past ten years. And sadly,
tools like Overleaf do not allow you to easily switch templates once you've
started writing.

In this project, the paper's title, authors and institutions are written in
a separate file called `authors.txt`:

    Applications of the Flux Capacitor
    
    Emmett Brown (1)
    Marty McFly (1)
    Biff Tannen (2)
    
    1
    Temporal Industries
    Hill Valley, CA 95420
    
    2
    BiffCo inc.
    Hill Valley, CA 95420

(You can optionally separate first and last names with braces, e.g.
`{Marty} {McFly}`. This is used in the EPTCS style for writing
abbreviated author names, e.g. "E. Brown, M. McFly, B. Tannen", etc.)

You then call a script named `set-style.php` to generate a preamble and
postamble with the proper syntax for the document classes you want to use. These
files are called `preamble.inc.tex` and `postamble.inc.tex`.

To change the authors or title, or to switch between document classes, modify
`authors.txt` and run`set-style.php` again. You then just need to recompile.
Voil√†!

Quick Use
---------

0. [Download and unzip](https://github.com/sylvainhalle/PaperShell/releases/latest)
   the PaperShell empty project in a folder of your choice.

1. Modify `authors.txt` with the desired title, authors and institutions.
   The file is self-documented and tells you how to do it.

2. Call `php set-style.php style` to generate the include files, which
   will be placed in the `Source` subfolder. (This requires
   [PHP](http://php.net/) to be installed in your path.) The word `style`
   must be replaced by the name of a paper template, which you can select
   from a long list. Some of the available styles are: lncs,
   ieee, acmconf, elsevier, springer, aaai, acmjour, eptcs, stvr, lipics,
   easychair, usenix.

3. Write your text as usual in `Source/paper.tex`. Figures should
   be placed in the `fig` subfolder. Write your abstract in
   `Source/abstract.tex`, and put any other imports and declarations in
   `Source/includes.tex`. Write anything that should go after the
   bibliography (such as appendices) in `Source/appendices.tex`.

4. To compile, use `make all`. To remove temporary files, use `make clean`.
   The Makefile has a very comprehensive list of other useful features. To
   read them, run `make help`.

5. To spell check, type `./aspell-check.sh` (in Linux) or `aspell-check.bat`
   (in Windows) from the project's top folder. Any additions to the
   personal dictionary will be reflected in changes to files
   `.aspell.en.prepl` and `.aspell.en.pws`, which are versioned with the
   rest of the project. See the file `aspell-check.readme` for instructions.

Extras
------

As an extra, the generated preamble files add a few commands that fix bugs
in some document classes.

- The preamble for IEEE journal fixes a [problem with a redefinition of the
  `\markboth` command](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/88864) that would
  otherwise prevent the document from compiling
- The postamble for Elsevier fixes the fact that the bibliography [does not have a section
  title](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/188625/no-references-title-using-elsevier-document-class)
- The EPTCS BibTeX file incorrectly handles `doi` fields that contain an underscore.
  PaperShell contains a fixed version.
- The LIPIcs style is incompatible with the `subfig` package.
  PaperShell contains a fixed version.
- The Springer Nature journal style has a [bug causing Tikz to break compilation](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/615012). PaperShell contains a fixed version.
- The Springer Nature journal style also redefines the `\href` command of the `hyperref` package in a way that the link's text is never shown. PaperShell has a version where this redefinition is commented out.

It also takes care of using fonts properly:

- The original style files load obsolete font packages; PaperShell overrides
  them with newer ones with much nicer math support (e.g. `lmodern` and
  `mathptmx` instead of `cmr` and `times`)
- In all styles, the Helvetica font (used in `\textsf`) [is larger than the
  text's normal font](http://www.hep.caltech.edu/~fcp/psnfss2e).
  PaperShell fixes this issue by scaling down Helvetica.

Exporting your sources
----------------------

If your paper is accepted (yay!), you may need to send the sources to the
editor so they can produce the final, "camera-ready version". Just zipping
your PaperShell `Source` folder will confuse a few of them, especially if
they have scripts trying to compile it automatically (many of them just
try to compile the first .tex file they find, which won't be the right one
in most cases).

From the root folder, you can call

    php export.php

Creates a stand-alone directory with all the sources. This script
reads the original source file (paper.tex using the defaults) and
replaces all non-commented
`\input{...}` instructions with the content of the file. It also includes
the bibliography (paper.bbl) directly within the file (so no need to
call BibTeX). The resulting,
stand-alone LaTeX file is copied to a new folder (`Export`), along with all
necessary auxiliary files (basically everything in the Source folder that
is not a .tex file).

Normally, what is present in the `Export` folder is a single compilable .tex
file (no `\include` or `\input`), plus class files and images. It is suitable
for sending as a bundle e.g. to an editor to compile the camera-ready
version. You can also bundle the whole thing (except the main .pdf file and
auxiliary files) in a single zip file using `zip-export.sh`.

Overleaf integration
--------------------

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an online collaborative platform for
editing LaTeX documents. Provided you have run `set-style.php` once, you can
import the whole project structure into Overleaf and edit it there; don't forget
to set `Source/paper.tex` as the main file.

If you want to change the document to another article class, simply re-run
`set-style.php` on your computer and re-upload `preamble.inc.tex`,
`midamble.inc.tex` and `postamble.inc.tex` to Overleaf. This is even easier if
you keep Overleaf in sync with a GitHub repository.

Cleaning up a BibTeX file
-------------------------

You can uniformize the presentation of BibTeX entries (indentation, etc.) and
remove duplicate entries by passing it into a script. In the root folder of
your project, type

    php clean-bibtex.php

This will read and parse `Source/paper.bib` and re-output a cleaned up version
at `Source/paper-clean.bib`. If everything looks good, you can then overwrite
the original `paper.bib` with this new file.

Overriding defaults
-------------------

Default settings can be overridden by giving values to parameters found
in `settings.inc.php`. All these settings are documented in detail in the
file. Make sure to call `generate-preamble.php` again after you change the
file.

In the case of ACM journals, you also have to overwrite `acm-ccs.tex` and
`acm-bottom.tex` with appropriate content.

### Changing the paper's filename

By default, the main paper is called `paper.tex`. We recommend that you leave
it that way: the whole point of using this environment is to use the same
commands and structure for all your papers, so customizing it for each paper
kind of defeats that. If you *must* change it to something else:

1. Make sure the filename does not contain spaces, or the `make` command
   will not do anything.
2. Make sure to change `paper.tex` by your filename in
   `Source/Variables.ini`.

Good practices
--------------

### Use a single tex file

Try to keep your paper in a single file (`paper.tex` if you use the
project defaults) ---that is, do not split the paper into `section-1.tex`,
`section-2.tex`, etc. that you `\input` inside `paper.tex`. A few reasons
for doing so:

- When spell checking, you have to run Aspell on a single file. Otherwise,
  you need to run it on every input file every time, and you cannot use
  the bundled script.
- Some publishers require you to upload a single stand-alone TeX file when
  submitting. PaperShell has a script that can do it for you if you use
  the defaults, but it may not work if your paper has multiple parts in
  separate files (this has not been tested).
- When searching for a word or an expression in your text editor, you have
  to search in a single file ---otherwise you have to search in all files.
- If your text editor has a "Compile with LaTeX" button, clicking on it
  when editing one of the `section-x.tex` will try to compile only that
  file and will fail. You have to go back to the main file every time you
  need to compile.
- If the goal is to make it possible to edit different parts of the same
  paper in parallel, don't forget you are using Git and that it should take
  care of this even if you edit the same file.
- If you move parts of text around, the changes are easier to track in Git
  if they don't jump from one file to another.
  
In all honesty, we don't see much benefit in splitting a 10-page paper
into multiple parts in separate files.
